# Android cold-start critical-path review

Date: 12 November 2026
Branch: main-build-testing

## Findings
Grok's central diagnosis is correct: Android keeps the splash screen until StartupPreloader finishes, before MainActivity calls Compose setContent. The preloader waited for Library, watched, watch progress, Continue Watching preferences, Player, P2P, Server, Meta Screen, release notifications and Live TV as well as profile and Home snapshot work. MainAppContent repeated several feature ensureLoaded calls in its first composition, so changing only the preloader would leave a second bottleneck.

Home requires a narrower set:
- Profile cache first; HomeSnapshotStore.currentProfileKey depends on the active profile.
- Watched history, watch progress and Continue Watching preferences are consumed by Home.
- The profile-keyed Home snapshot must load after profile restoration.
- Downloader platform recovery remains parallel with Home-critical reads.

LibraryRepository.ensureLoaded prepares tracking providers and provider refresh work, but is not needed to draw Home's Continue Watching shelf. It moves after first draw. LibraryScreen retains its own ensure; the Home poster action overlay ensures Library before checking local/remote membership.

## Implementation
- Added a single-flight coordinator for critical and post-frame phases.
- Android Activity awaits only critical work before setContent.
- A Compose effect waits for a frame and starts post-frame warmup.
- Critical: profile cache, watched, watch progress, Continue Watching preferences and Home snapshot.
- Critical: lightweight Android downloader scheduler construction remains in parallel with Home-critical repository restoration; the transfer-record scan is deferred.
- Post-frame: Android transfer-record scan on IO, DownloadsRepository manifest restore, Live TV, Player, P2P, Server, Meta Screen and Library.
- Android root first-composition feature ensures are deferred; iOS eager behavior is preserved.
- Notification refresh waits for a frame on Android; iOS timing is preserved.
- LiveTvUiState records when playlist preferences are restored. Initial and native tab decisions wait for this signal, preventing a valid Live TV startup route from being redirected while the default state is visible.
- Home catalog refresh waits for the Server repository's first loaded revision.
- DownloadsUiState.isLoaded gates initial offline fallback until the active profile's saved manifest is restored.

## Regression tests added
- Coordinator: critical await does not run post-frame work; concurrent waiters share initialization; post-frame waits for critical completion and only starts once.
- Offline route: waits for manifest restore, Home readiness and known network state; does not repeat after handling.

## Research consulted
Context7: Compose Multiplatform frame/effect APIs and Kotlin Coroutines structured concurrency. Existing versions remain Compose Multiplatform 1.13.0-beta01, Kotlin 2.4.10 and kotlinx-coroutines 1.10.2; no dependency changes.

Android guidance warns background prewarming still contends for CPU, storage and network. No unrelated image/cache work is added.

## Follow-up optimization — 14 November 2026

Two further non-essential operations were removed from the Android pre-`setContent` path:

- Episode-release notification platform initialization now stores context only. It no longer performs the notification-manager channel check or first-install channel creation before Compose draws. The permission, scheduling, test-send, and due-delivery paths retain channel creation; due delivery performs the check on `Dispatchers.IO`.
- Add-on HTTP client construction is deferred until the first add-on request. Previously the provider built a default client and immediately replaced it with a second client configured with the 50 MiB cache. The provider now builds one configured client lazily. Both current request entry points already execute inside `Dispatchers.IO`.

The app pins OkHttp 4.12.0. Its tagged `Cache.kt` documents that journal loading is performed by explicit `Cache.initialize()`, while normal cache initialization is lazy on first use. Nuvio did not call `Cache.initialize()`; no startup disk-journal scan was claimed or optimized. The demonstrated saving is limited to removing the duplicate/eager client construction and moving its first creation off the UI startup path.

Regression tests cover deferred channel creation and lazy, single-instance client creation under concurrency. Context7 was attempted for the exact library documentation but its monthly quota was exhausted; Exa checked the tagged Square OkHttp source and official Android startup guidance.

No launch-time benchmark, Macrobenchmark, Gradle/Xcode test, build, CI run, or device verification was performed. The changes are expected to reduce pre-first-frame work, but the actual user-visible latency improvement is unmeasured.

## Validation
Focused regression tests are added but not run. No measured latency improvement is claimed; physical-device timing is required. No Gradle build, CI run or Macrobenchmark is claimed. No GitHub Actions workflow is dispatched.

## Follow-up optimization — defer Android transfer-record loading

The Android startup critical phase previously called `DownloadsPlatformDownloader.prepareForStartup()` on IO and awaited it before `setContent`. Although the work was off the main thread, constructing `AndroidDownloadScheduler` constructed `AndroidDownloadStore`, whose StateFlow initializer synchronously enumerated the transfer directory and decoded every persisted JSON record. The Activity still waited for this storage work to finish.

Changes:
- `AndroidDownloadStore` now initializes its transfer StateFlow lazily with Kotlin's synchronized lazy mode. Constructing the scheduler no longer scans or decodes transfer records.
- The critical phase still constructs the lightweight Android scheduler in parallel with Home-critical work, but lazy store initialization means it no longer scans transfer files.
- The post-frame phase explicitly touches the transfer store on `Dispatchers.IO` before restoring the common DownloadsRepository manifest on its existing Main-thread path. `DownloadsScreen` also awaits this preload on IO if opened before post-frame warm-up completes.
- The iOS implementation of the new preload hook is a no-op. iOS background URLSession behavior and the existing profile-manifest restore ordering are unchanged.
- First access remains single-initialization and thread-safe; subsequent reads use the same StateFlow. Download record format, IDs, generations, scheduling, resume and pause behavior are unchanged.

Regression coverage added (not executed):
- Store construction leaves the transfer store uninitialized.
- First access initializes the store.
- A persisted transfer is restored from disk on first access.

Kotlin's official standard-library documentation states that `LazyThreadSafetyMode.SYNCHRONIZED` uses a lock to ensure one initializer and safe publication to all threads: https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin/-lazy-thread-safety-mode/-s-y-n-c-h-r-o-n-i-z-e-d/. Context7 was attempted but its monthly quota was exhausted, so the exact-library Context7 requirement could not be satisfied for this cycle. No dependency was changed.

Expected benefit: transfer-directory enumeration and JSON decoding no longer delay the initial Android screen. The work is intentionally retained after first frame and remains on IO; no reduction in total work or measured launch-time improvement is claimed.

## First-frame safety follow-up

A final call-site audit found that users can open Downloads immediately after the first frame, before post-frame warm-up completes. To avoid a race in which the lazy store would otherwise be loaded synchronously from the screen's composition path, `DownloadsScreen` now awaits the transfer-store preload on IO before restoring the common manifest. The screen retains its normal list/empty state after restoration and shows a loading indicator while restoration is pending. Lightweight scheduler construction remains critical, preserving immediate availability of the platform scheduler; only the file scan and JSON decoding move out of the first-frame wait.
