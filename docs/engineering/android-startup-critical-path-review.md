# Android cold-start critical-path review

Date: 12 November 2026
Branch: main-build-testing

## Findings
Grok's central diagnosis is correct: Android keeps the splash screen until StartupPreloader finishes, before MainActivity calls Compose setContent. The preloader waited for Library, watched, watch progress, Continue Watching preferences, Player, P2P, Server, Meta Screen, release notifications and Live TV as well as profile and Home snapshot work. MainAppContent repeated several feature ensureLoaded calls in its first composition, so changing only the preloader would leave a second bottleneck.

Home requires a narrower set:
- Profile cache first; HomeSnapshotStore.currentProfileKey depends on the active profile.
- Watched history, watch progress and Continue Watching preferences are consumed by Home.
- The profile-keyed Home snapshot must load after profile restoration.
- Downloader platform recovery remains parallel with Home-critical reads.

LibraryRepository.ensureLoaded prepares tracking providers and provider refresh work, but is not needed to draw Home's Continue Watching shelf. It moves after first draw. LibraryScreen retains its own ensure; the Home poster action overlay ensures Library before checking local/remote membership.

## Implementation
- Added a single-flight coordinator for critical and post-frame phases.
- Android Activity awaits only critical work before setContent.
- A Compose effect waits for a frame and starts post-frame warmup.
- Critical: profile cache, watched, watch progress, Continue Watching preferences and Home snapshot; downloader platform recovery parallel.
- Post-frame: DownloadsRepository manifest restore, Live TV, Player, P2P, Server, Meta Screen and Library.
- Android root first-composition feature ensures are deferred; iOS eager behavior is preserved.
- Notification refresh waits for a frame on Android; iOS timing is preserved.
- LiveTvUiState records when playlist preferences are restored. Initial and native tab decisions wait for this signal, preventing a valid Live TV startup route from being redirected while the default state is visible.
- Home catalog refresh waits for the Server repository's first loaded revision.
- DownloadsUiState.isLoaded gates initial offline fallback until the active profile's saved manifest is restored.

## Regression tests added
- Coordinator: critical await does not run post-frame work; concurrent waiters share initialization; post-frame waits for critical completion and only starts once.
- Offline route: waits for manifest restore, Home readiness and known network state; does not repeat after handling.

## Research consulted
Context7: Compose Multiplatform frame/effect APIs and Kotlin Coroutines structured concurrency. Existing versions remain Compose Multiplatform 1.13.0-beta01, Kotlin 2.4.10 and kotlinx-coroutines 1.10.2; no dependency changes.

Android guidance warns background prewarming still contends for CPU, storage and network. No unrelated image/cache work is added.

## Validation
Focused regression tests are added but not run. No measured latency improvement is claimed; physical-device timing is required. No Gradle build, CI run or Macrobenchmark is claimed. No GitHub Actions workflow is dispatched.
